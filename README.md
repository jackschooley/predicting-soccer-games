# Predicting the Outcomes of Soccer Games

This paper and code catalogues the work that I did for my Honors Thesis at the University of Connecticut. You can read a little bit about
the project [here](https://iisp.uconn.edu/2020/06/15/predicting-outcomes/).

Thank you to [Dr. Jun Yan](https://stat.uconn.edu/jun-yan/) for advising me throughout the entire process and also to 
[Dr. Néhémy Lim](https://stat.uconn.edu/nehemy-lim/) for providing significant feedback.
